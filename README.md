# Secret Lodge

In this project, Iâ€™ll implement an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This is part of cirriculum on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication)
